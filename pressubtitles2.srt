00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 Quick demonstration on how to use my Computer Vision Valorant Map Analyzer software.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,000
 So, when you're in the GitHub page, just click on the latest release, and you'll be given an option to download the installation.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,200
 Just click on that, and the installation should start straight away.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,200
 Now, once it's open, just right click it, extract it.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,500
 It is a zip file, so you don't need WinRAR to extract it.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 Once it's done extracting, just double click the installation file, follow the instructions provided.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,300
 Now that the download is finished, you have the option to either launch it straight from the installer,

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,500
 or you can launch it from the desktop icon, or the start menu item.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,300
 So once you start, it will ask for admin privileges, which should be approved.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:56,300
 It takes a while for the application to start up, but once it's started up, it will pop up on the screen where your cursor is.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,100
 So now that the application has started up, we have a few options here.

12
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,100
 Not much is explained at the moment, we do have a prerequisites section, but that is empty.

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,100
 So now we'll move over to explaining how to use the application.

14
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,100
 So, to start the tracker, very simple, just click the start button.

15
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,100
 It'll take a second to start, ideally you shouldn't be clicking anything while you're waiting for it to start.

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,100
 Just wait for it to start, and once it's started, it will be running straight away.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,100
 It will also be making predictions straight away, which you won't be able to see.

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,100
 I've just opened up a recording of a game, and there we go, we just have some players running around.

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:48,100
 What I can do is I can create a zone to start tracking from, and now, so I just want to track a site, I set the zone, a site's being tracked.

20
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,100
 So of course we don't have any players on the screen, so we can do select friendlies, we can't unselect players until we select something else.

21
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,100
 So now it's tracking that we have three friendlies on a site.

22
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,100
 We can name the zone through the label tracker over here.

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,100
 There are some extra options that haven't been implemented yet, so that can be ignored.

24
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,100
 These are the three sub-pages on the main page.

25
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,100
 So to clear the zones, just clear all, and you're back to normal.

26
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:37,100
 It also has a small FPS counter, just in case you want to know how fast it's running, and optionally later you can change between different models, or you can change between using a CPU or a GPU.

27
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,100
 So if I do that again, just put players as well, there we go.

28
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:52,100
 Okay, so if we move over to the menu, just stop this for now, and we move over to account page, we can see that we can implement our accounts page.

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:05,100
 The only two editable tags, line edits, is the username and tagline, so this is where you put your username and your tagline for your account.

30
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:14,100
 This will be saved on your computer, so every time you reload the app, it will load with the app.

31
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,100
 Next, we have a submit bug page, so this allows you to submit a bug report, feature request, or performance issue.

32
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,100
 You can submit your real email, or you can put fake email if you don't want any replies.

33
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:38,100
 Later down the line we'll implement a no reply email, so you don't have to submit your email, but it's good in this case.

34
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,100
 Anyway, you can submit a bug report, feature report, performance report, through this page.

35
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:54,100
 Yeah, so the final thing at the bottom here, this controls what is being seen here, so if I start it up again, I clear all the zones.

36
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:01,100
 We can change this to 340, it stretches it out, 350 or something.

37
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:15,100
 Now we just have more of the map, so it's easier to select the zones of the map, so that's zone 1, A, and zone B, you see?

38
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:23,100
 And also the spawn, so it allows you to be more precise with your selections, that's what this section does.

39
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:34,100
 This section has a little bug causing it to do that, but to fix that you just go plus or minus one or two values and it should fix.

40
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:48,100
 Before I forget, the final feature that's implemented is a hide feature, so it allows the application to be hidden and shown in case you just have one monitor on the screen.

41
00:04:49,100 --> 00:05:00,100
 And finally, to uninstall the application, it's very simple, you just go to where you installed the application, mine was Disk C, Program Files, C, V, F, V, M, A.

42
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:09,100
 Double click the uninstall file, do I want to completely remove? Yes, and it will finish uninstalling.
