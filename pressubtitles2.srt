 Quick demonstration on how to use my Computer Vision Valorant Map Analyzer

2
0:00:06,880000 --> 0:00:11,520000
 software. So when you're in the GitHub page just click on the latest release

3
0:00:11,520000 --> 0:00:15,640000
 and you'll be given an option to download the installation. Just click on

4
0:00:15,640000 --> 0:00:21,200000
 that and the installation should start straight away. Now once it's open just

5
0:00:21,200000 --> 0:00:25,760000
 right-click it, extract it. It is a zip file so you don't need WinRAR to

6
0:00:25,760000 --> 0:00:29,880000
 extract it. Once it's done extracting just double-click the installation file

7
0:00:29,880000 --> 0:00:35,240000
 follow the instructions provided. Now that the download is finished you have

8
0:00:35,240000 --> 0:00:38,120000
 the option to either launch it straight from the installer or you can launch it

9
0:00:38,120000 --> 0:00:43,120000
 from the desktop icon or the start menu item. So once you start it will ask for

10
0:00:43,120000 --> 0:00:47,800000
 admin privileges should be approved. It takes a while for the application to

11
0:00:47,800000 --> 0:00:55,160000
 start up but once it's started up it will pop up on your screen where your

12
0:00:55,160000 --> 0:00:59,240000
 cursor is. There we go. So now the application has started up we have a

13
0:00:59,240000 --> 0:01:03,320000
 few options here. Not much is explained at the moment we do have a prerequisites

14
0:01:03,320000 --> 0:01:09,720000
 section but that is empty. So now we'll move over to explaining how to use the

15
0:01:09,720000 --> 0:01:15,600000
 application. So to start the tracker very simple you just click the start button

16
0:01:15,600000 --> 0:01:20,240000
 it'll take a second to start. Ideally you shouldn't be clicking anything while

17
0:01:20,240000 --> 0:01:24,640000
 you're waiting for it to start. Just wait for it to start and once it's started it

18
0:01:24,640000 --> 0:01:27,560000
 will be running straight away. We'll also be making predictions straight away

19
0:01:27,560000 --> 0:01:32,920000
 which you won't be able to see. I've just opened up a recording of a game and

20
0:01:32,920000 --> 0:01:39
 there we go we just have some players running around. What I can do is I can

21
0:01:39 --> 0:01:45,640000
 create a zone to start tracking from and now so I just want to track a site I set

22
0:01:45,640000 --> 0:01:49,760000
 the zone a sites being tracked. So of course we don't have any players on the

23
0:01:49,760000 --> 0:01:53,480000
 screen so we can do a select friendlies we can't unselect players until we

24
0:01:53,480000 --> 0:01:56,640000
 select something else. So friendlies all right so now it's tracking that we have

25
0:01:56,640000 --> 0:02:04,360000
 three friendlies on a site. We can name the zone through the label tracker over

26
0:02:04,360000 --> 0:02:10,840000
 here. There are some extra options haven't been implemented yet so that can

27
0:02:10,840000 --> 0:02:17,840000
 be ignored. These are the three sub pages on the main page. So to clear the zones

28
0:02:17,840000 --> 0:02:23,720000
 just clear all and you're back to normal. It also has a small FPS counter just in

29
0:02:23,720000 --> 0:02:30,200000
 case you want to know how fast it's running and optionally later you could

30
0:02:30,200000 --> 0:02:37,880000
 change between different models or you can change between using a CPU or GPU. So

31
0:02:37,880000 --> 0:02:44,520000
 if I do that again put players as well there we go. Okay so if we move over to

32
0:02:44,600000 --> 0:02:49,960000
 the menu just stop this for now and we move over to account page we can see

33
0:02:49,960000 --> 0:02:57,760000
 that we can implement our accounts page. The only two editable tags, line edits is

34
0:02:57,760000 --> 0:03:01,400000
 the username and tagline. So this is where you put your username and your

35
0:03:01,400000 --> 0:03:08,320000
 tagline for your account. This will be saved on your computer so every time you

36
0:03:08,320000 --> 0:03:19
 reload the app it will load with the app. Okay next we have a submit bug page so

37
0:03:19 --> 0:03:22,680000
 this allows you to submit a bug report, feature requests or performance issue.

38
0:03:22,680000 --> 0:03:28,240000
 You can submit your real email or you can put fake email if you don't want any

39
0:03:28,240000 --> 0:03:33,280000
 replies. Later down the line we'll implement a no reply email so you

40
0:03:33,280000 --> 0:03:38,520000
 don't have to submit your email but it's like it's good in this case. Anyway

41
0:03:38,520000 --> 0:03:42,080000
 you can submit a bug report, feature report, performance report through this

42
0:03:42,080000 --> 0:03:50,080000
 page. Yeah so the final thing at the bottom here this controls what is being

43
0:03:50,080000 --> 0:03:55,240000
 seen here so if I started it up again I clear all the zones. We can change this

44
0:03:55,240000 --> 0:04:02,240000
 to 340 it stretches it out 350 or something. Now we just have more of the

45
0:04:02,240000 --> 0:04:12,880000
 map so it's easier to select the zones of the map. So that's zone 1A and zone B

46
0:04:12,880000 --> 0:04:21,160000
 you see and also the spawn. So it allows you to be more precise with your

47
0:04:21,160000 --> 0:04:26,680000
 selections. That's what this section does. This section can has a little bug

48
0:04:26,680000 --> 0:04:32
 causing it to do that but to fix that you just go plus or minus like one or

49
0:04:32 --> 0:04:38,240000
 two values and it should fix. Before I forget the final feature that's

50
0:04:38,240000 --> 0:04:43,720000
 implemented is a hide feature so it allows the application to be hidden and

51
0:04:43,720000 --> 0:04:51,160000
 shown in case you just have one monitor on the screen. And finally to uninstall

52
0:04:51,160000 --> 0:04:54,600000
 the application it's very simple. You just go to where you installed the

53
0:04:54,600000 --> 0:05:01,440000
 application and mine was disk C program files CVFVMA. Double click the

54
0:05:01,440000 --> 0:05:10,520000
 uninstall file. Do I want to completely remove? Yes. And it will finish uninstalling.
